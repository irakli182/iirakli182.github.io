    <h1 class="headline"> Welcome to Caesar's cipher!</h1>


    <p class="paragraph">The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique. Its simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials. </p>
